# Terra Protocol — Whitepaper v1.0

## 1. Introduction

Terra Protocol is a rights-based economic coordination system designed for real-world communities operating within the Polkadot ecosystem. The protocol enables programmable economic rights, cross-chain payments, governance coordination, and incentive routing. Using a hybrid architecture—smart contracts on Moonbeam and future Substrate pallets—Terra provides both rapid deployability and long-term scalability.

The protocol avoids property tokenization and instead models rights and incentives as programmable abstractions, ensuring technical flexibility and regulatory alignment.

## 2. Governance Framework

### 2.1 Governance Layers

Terra uses a tri-layer governance structure:

1. **Project Governance (GitHub)** — Development oversight and repository management.  
2. **Protocol Governance (TerraDAO)** — On-chain governance for parameters, budgets, and rights.  
3. **Ecosystem Governance (Polkadot OpenGov)** — Treasury funding and ecosystem-wide decisions.

Each layer serves a distinct role while maintaining composability and transparency.

### 2.2 Project Governance (GitHub)

During Phase 1, governance is maintainer-led using rough consensus.

Responsibilities include:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests  
- Ensuring repository quality and documentation  
- Managing releases and architecture consistency  
- Conducting security reviews  

### 2.3 Protocol Governance (TerraDAO)

TerraDAO governs:
- Economic configuration  
- Rights metadata  
- Incentive structures  
- Treasury allocations  
- Local economy onboarding  

### 2.4 Dual-Token Governance Model

#### GOVT Token — Governance Power
- Inflationary  
- Used exclusively for voting  
- Earned through contribution and participation  
- Not tied to revenue share  

#### TERRA Token — Economic Rights
- Fixed supply  
- Represents participation and revenue rights  
- Does not grant governance power  

### 2.5 Governance Process

2. Discussion  
3. Voting (GOVT token)  
4. Execution  

### 2.6 Governance Roadmap

**Phase 1:** Maintainer-led, off-chain simulation  
**Phase 2:** TerraDAO activation  
**Phase 3:** Multi-community governance + XCM-based interactions

## 3. Tokenomics

Terra introduces a three-token architecture:
- **TERRA** (economic rights token)  
- **GOVT** (governance token)  
- **WORK** (internal economy token)  

### 3.1 TERRA Token

**Purpose:** Represents economic rights and revenue share.  
**Supply:** Fixed.  
**Distribution:**  
- 55% Treasury  
- 20% Workers  
- 20% Team (4-year vesting)  
- 5% Partners  

### 3.2 GOVT Token

**Purpose:** Governance voting power.  
**Supply:** Inflationary, tied to participation.  
**Role:** Parameter updates, rights rules, budgets.

### 3.3 WORK Token

**Purpose:** Worker compensation and internal economic operations.  
**Supply:** Elastic via bonding curve.  
**Role:** Micro-task payments, incentives, and service markets.

### 3.4 Revenue Model40% TERRA holders
40% WORK ecosystem
20% Treasury
### 3.5 Rights-Based Tokenization

Rights encode:
- Access  
- Usage  
- Contribution  
- Economic privileges  

Rights are metadata-controlled and do not represent ownership.

## 4. Economic Model & Incentive Flows

### 4.1 TERRA Rights Layer
Represents long-term participation and revenue rights.

### 4.2 GOVT Governance Layer
Uses inflation to reward active contributors and prevent plutocratic capture.

### 4.3 WORK Operational Layer
Used for:
- Worker payments  
- Task markets  
- Local budgets  
- Micro-economies  

### 4.4 Incentive Flows

**Worker Compensation**
Work Performed → WORK issued → Worker wallet
**Revenue Distribution**
Revenue → Router → TERRA / WORK / Treasury
**Governance Incentives**
Participation → GOVT issuance
**Treasury Feedback Loop**
Treasury → Local Economies → More Activity → More Revenue → Treasury Growth

## 5. Technical Architecture

Terra uses a hybrid deployment combining:

- **Moonbeam smart contracts** (Phase 1)  
- **Substrate FRAME pallets** (Phase 2+)  
- **XCM Routers** for cross-chain operations  

### 5.1 Hybrid Overview

Smart contracts allow rapid deployment, while runtime pallets provide long-term performance and security.

### 5.2 Rights Engine

Manages:
- Rights creation  
- Metadata  
- Access rules  
- Rights binding (tasks, roles, communities)

Structure:RightsEngine
├─ RightsRegistry
├─ MetadataStore
├─ AccessPolicy
├─ RightsBinding
└─ EvaluationModule
### 5.3 Revenue Router

Implements the 40/40/20 split with deterministic logic.  
Upgradeable to runtime-level pallet execution.

### 5.4 Bonding Curve Module (WORK)

WORK minted/burned via bonding curve:Price = a * Supply + b
Future enhancements: exponential, logistic, piecewise models.

### 5.5 XCM Payment Router

Handles:
- cross-chain DOT, USDC, WORK  
- multi-location payments  
- fee abstraction  
- revenue routing across chains  

### 5.6 Governance Integration Layer

Manages parameter changes and governance decisions.

### 5.7 Treasury Module

Allocates funds to:
- local economies  
- developers  
- liquidity  
- expansion efforts  

### 5.8 Terra SDK

Rust + TypeScript SDK for:
- rights management  
- bonding curve interactions  
- treasury actions  
- cross-chain payments

## 6. Risk & Security Analysis

### 6.1 Protocol Risks
- State divergence  
- Unsafe upgrades  

**Mitigation:** canonical state, static analysis, multi-stage deployment.

### 6.2 Smart Contract Risks
- Reentrancy  
- Overflow  
- Access control issues  

**Mitigation:** OpenZeppelin patterns, non-reentrancy, audits.

### 6.3 XCM Risks
- Replay  
- Message failure  
- Queue blocking  

**Mitigation:** versioned messages, acknowledgement, bounded weights.

### 6.4 Governance Risks
- Capture  
- Low turnout  

**Mitigation:** GOVT inflation, quorum, conviction voting.

### 6.5 Economic Risks
- Bonding curve manipulation  
- Router misallocation  

**Mitigation:** limits, circuit breakers, checksums.

### 6.6 RWA Operational Risks
- Misuse of rights  
- Local operational errors  

**Mitigation:** metadata constraints, community governance.

### 6.7 Systemic Risks
- Parachain downtime  
- Economic instability  

**Mitigation:** fallback modes, smoothing functions.

## 7. Conclusion

Terra Protocol provides a scalable, rights-based coordination layer for real-world communities on Polkadot. Through hybrid architecture, programmable rights, transparent governance, and cross-chain interoperability, Terra enables economic systems that are modular, secure, and aligned with Polkadot’s vision of decentralized coordination.

The protocol's tokenomics, governance framework, and technical design form a robust foundation for long-term adoption and expansion across globally distributed micro-economies.
