# 🌍 Terra Protocol  
### Real-World Economic Infrastructure Layer for Polkadot

Terra Protocol is an open-source framework enabling real-world economic systems — such as land-based projects, decentralized communities, and worker-driven economies — to operate natively on Polkadot.

This repository contains the core specifications, architecture, roadmap, and SDK foundations for Phase 1.

---

# 🚀 Vision

Terra aims to bring **real economic activity on-chain**, using Polkadot’s governance, interoperability, and security to coordinate:

- land-based projects  
- decentralized village infrastructures  
- worker-owned resource economies  
- recursive revenue-sharing models  
- treasury return mechanisms  
- real-world payments (DOT, stablecoins, local tokens)

Terra is **not a real-estate project**.  
It is a **protocol layer** for governing and operating real-world economic systems.

---

# 🧩 Why Polkadot?

Polkadot provides:

- **OpenGov** (best governance system in Web3)  
- **XCM** (cross-chain payments and interoperability)  
- **on-chain Treasury funding**  
- **parachains optimized for RWAs (Moonbeam, Astar, HydraDX)**  

Terra builds the **economic & governance layer** on top of this foundation.

# 🛠 Core Components (Phase 1)

### 1. Rights-Based Asset Framework  
A regulatory-safe standard for tokenizing **economic rights**, not real-world ownership.

### 2. XCM Payment Router  
Cross-chain settlement between:

- DOT  
- stablecoins  
- WORK (local token)  
- TERRA (rights token)

### 3. Governance Integration Layer  
OpenGov-compatible module for:

- budget approvals  
- worker compensation  
- revenue distribution  
- treasury return mechanisms  

### 4. Developer SDK  
Tools enabling other RWA and GovTech projects to use Terra Protocol.

# 🔗 Real-World Use Case Examples

Although Terra is a protocol, it enables:

- decentralized eco-villages  
- regenerative land ownership systems  
- energy-producing micro-grids  
- worker-owned communities  
- DAO-operated tourism concepts  
- distributed agriculture networks  

DOT plays a role as:

- reserve asset  
- governance currency  
- payment method  
- liquidity routing token
