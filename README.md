# 🌍 Terra Protocol  
### Real-World Economic Infrastructure Layer for Polkadot

Terra Protocol is an open-source framework enabling real-world economic systems — such as land-based projects, decentralized communities, and worker-driven economies — to operate natively on Polkadot.

This repository contains the core specifications, architecture, roadmap, and SDK foundations for Phase 1.

---

# 🚀 Vision

Terra aims to bring **real economic activity on-chain**, using Polkadot’s governance, interoperability, and security to coordinate:

- land-based projects  
- decentralized village infrastructures  
- worker-owned resource economies  
- recursive revenue-sharing models  
- treasury return mechanisms  
- real-world payments (DOT, stablecoins, local tokens)

Terra is **not a real-estate project**.  
It is a **protocol layer** for governing and operating real-world economic systems.

# Terra Protocol – Multi-Treasury Economic Rights System  
### README v1.0

Terra is a real-world economic coordination system designed to operate as a network-based economic nation.  
It replaces traditional salary-based labor structures with **rights-based economic earnings** distributed through a **multi-layered Revenue Router**.

---

## 1. Overview

Terra manages global real-world economic activity through a set of independent but coordinated Treasuries.  
Each Treasury funds a specific dimension of the Terra economy:

- **Global Treasury** – land, infrastructure, macro-level decisions  
- **Sector Treasuries** – labor, energy, development, governance  
- **Local Treasuries** – autonomous villages, districts, micro-territories  
- **Role-Based Treasuries** – auditors, emergency responders, special service entities  

Funds are distributed through the **Terra Revenue Router**, an on-chain module that allocates incoming economic income across Treasuries and participants.

Terra does *not* pay salaries.  
Instead, Terra distributes **Economic Rights** to eligible participants.  
These Rights generate recurring earnings, similar to dividends, royalties, or cooperative profit shares.

This structure is designed to reduce tax exposure, avoid payroll classification, increase global neutrality, and ensure the longevity of the Terra economic system.

---

## 2. Economic Rights Classes

Participants in Terra are assigned to **Earnings Classes**, including but not limited to:

- `Worker Class`  
- `Builder Class`  
- `Steward Class`  
- `Founder Class`  
- `Local Council Class`  
- `Infrastructure Class`  
- `Emergency Class`

Each Class has:

- **Earnings Weight** (e.g., 0.8x, 1.0x, 2.0x)  
- **Distribution Frequency**  
- **Allowed Treasury Sources**  
- **Eligibility Logic**  
- **Max Allocation Limits**

Economic Rights are **not tied to hours worked**, preventing classification as salary and ensuring compliance with global jurisdictions.

---

## 3. Multi-Treasury Architecture

Terra uses multiple independent Treasuries, each with its own accounting and spending logic.

### 3.1 Global Treasury  
Funds macro-level infrastructure, land acquisition, and large-scale economic investments.

### 3.2 Sector Treasuries  
- `Labor Treasury`  
- `Energy Treasury`  
- `Development Treasury`  
- `Governance Treasury`

Each Sector Treasury receives allocations based on demand, cost models, and systemic importance.

### 3.3 Local Treasuries  
Each Terra Village or District receives its own autonomous Treasury.  
Local Councils can spend funds without global referendums.

### 3.4 Role-Based Treasuries  
Treasuries dedicated to specific roles such as auditors, emergency teams, and investigators.

---

## 4. Revenue Router System

The **Terra Revenue Router** performs three key functions:

### 4.1 Allocation  
Incoming revenue flows into a Meta-Router which allocates funds to Treasuries based on:

- fixed base percentages  
- dynamic demand  
- cost-to-impact models  
- emergency conditions  
- supply/demand of workers  
- infrastructure load  
- governance-defined rules

### 4.2 Rights Distribution  
The Router distributes earnings to holders of Economic Rights.  
These are not salaries but **profit-like distributions**.

### 4.3 Safety  
To prevent misuse, the Router includes:

- multi-sig authorization  
- per-period spending caps  
- circuit-breakers  
- audit hooks  
- role-verification  
- risk-weight limits  

---

## 5. Tax and Legal Position

Because Terra distributes **Economic Rights** instead of salary:

- earnings are **not classified as payroll**  
- no hourly/contractual dependency exists  
- many jurisdictions treat them as dividends or passive income  
- often taxed at 0–20% (sometimes 0%)  
- avoids social taxes and employment classification  

Terra remains compliant with international labor and tax law.

---

## 6. Design Philosophy

- No centralized payroll  
- No salaries  
- No employment contracts required  
- Autonomous, federated Treasuries  
- Earnings as a function of **citizenship and contribution rights**  
- Scalable governance similar to a digital–physical nation  

---

## 7. Future Roadmap

- Router simulations  
- Treasury modularization  
- Rights-class registry module  
- Multi-sig & safety layer implementation  
- Local Treasury API  
- Economic Rights NFT/FT hybrid model  
- Governance expansion  
- Real-world Terra Territories

# 🧩 Why Polkadot?

Polkadot provides:

- **OpenGov** (best governance system in Web3)  
- **XCM** (cross-chain payments and interoperability)  
- **on-chain Treasury funding**  
- **parachains optimized for RWAs (Moonbeam, Astar, HydraDX)**  

Terra builds the **economic & governance layer** on top of this foundation.

---

# 🛠 Core Components (Phase 1)

### 1. Rights-Based Asset Framework  
A regulatory-safe standard for tokenizing **economic rights**, not real-world ownership.

### 2. XCM Payment Router  
Cross-chain settlement between:

- DOT  
- stablecoins  
- WORK (local token)  
- TERRA (rights token)

### 3. Governance Integration Layer  
OpenGov-compatible module for:

- budget approvals  
- worker compensation  
- revenue distribution  
- treasury return mechanisms  

### 4. Developer SDK  
Tools enabling other RWA and GovTech projects to use Terra Protocol.

# 🔗 Real-World Use Case Examples

Although Terra is a protocol, it enables:

- decentralized eco-villages  
- regenerative land ownership systems  
- energy-producing micro-grids  
- worker-owned communities  
- DAO-operated tourism concepts  
- distributed agriculture networks  

DOT plays a role as:

- reserve asset  
- governance currency  
- payment method  
- liquidity routing token
