Terra Protocol — Whitepaper v1.0

1. Introduction
Terra Protocol is a rights-based economic coordination system designed for real-world communities operating within the Polkadot ecosystem. The protocol enables programmable economic rights, cross-chain payments, governance coordination, and incentive routing. Using a hybrid architecture—smart contracts on Moonbeam and future Substrate pallets—Terra provides both rapid deployability and long-term scalability.
The protocol avoids property tokenization and instead models rights and incentives as programmable abstractions, ensuring technical flexibility and regulatory alignment.

2. Governance Framework
Terra uses a tri-layer governance structure:
1. Project Governance (GitHub)
2. Protocol Governance (TerraDAO)
3. Ecosystem Governance (Polkadot OpenGov)

Project Governance (GitHub)
During Phase 1, governance is maintainer-led using rough consensus.
Responsibilities include: reviewing and merging pull requests, ensuring repository quality and documentation, managing releases, and conducting security reviews.

TerraDAO Governance
TerraDAO governs: economic configuration, rights metadata, incentives, treasury allocations, and local economy onboarding.

Dual-Token Governance Model
GOVT Token — Governance Power: inflationary, earned through participation, used for voting.
TERRA Token — Economic Rights: fixed supply, represents participation and revenue rights.

Governance Process: Proposal → Discussion → Voting → Execution

Governance Roadmap:
Phase 1: Maintainer-led
Phase 2: TerraDAO activation
Phase 3: Multi-community governance + XCM interactions

3. Tokenomics
Three-token architecture: TERRA, GOVT, WORK

TERRA Token
Purpose: economic rights and revenue share
Supply: fixed
Distribution: 55% Treasury, 20% Workers, 20% Team (4-year vesting), 5% Partners

GOVT Token
Purpose: governance voting power
Supply: inflationary
Role: decision-making and parameter updates

WORK Token
Purpose: worker compensation and internal economic operations
Supply: elastic via bonding curve

Revenue Model:
40% TERRA holders
40% WORK liquidity
20% Treasury

Rights-Based Tokenization: rights represent access, usage, contribution—not property ownership.

4. Economic Model & Incentive Flows
TERRA Rights Layer: long-term participation and revenue rights.
GOVT Governance Layer: prevents plutocratic capture through inflation.
WORK Operational Layer: worker payments, task markets, local budgets.

Incentive Flows:
Worker compensation → WORK token issuance
Revenue distribution → 40/40/20 router
Governance incentives → GOVT issuance
Treasury feedback loop → supports local economies

5. Technical Architecture
Hybrid deployment: Moonbeam smart contracts + Substrate pallets + XCM Router

Rights Engine: manages rights, metadata, access rules, binding logic.
Revenue Router: deterministic 40/40/20 split.
Bonding Curve Module: WORK mint/burn pricing.
XCM Payment Router: multi-chain payments and fee abstraction.
Governance Integration Layer: parameter control.
Treasury Module: funds local economies and developers.
Terra SDK: Rust + TypeScript for developers.

6. Risk & Security Analysis
Protocol Risks: state divergence, unsafe upgrades.
Smart Contract Risks: reentrancy, overflows.
XCM Risks: replay, message failure, routing issues.
Governance Risks: capture, low turnout.
Economic Risks: bonding curve manipulation, router misallocation.
RWA Risks: operational failures, rights misinterpretation.
Systemic Risks: parachain downtime, economic instability.

7. Conclusion
Terra Protocol provides a scalable, rights-based coordination layer for real-world communities on Polkadot. Through hybrid architecture, transparent governance, programmable rights, and cross-chain interoperability, Terra offers a technically robust and economically sustainable system aligned with Polkadot's decentralized coordination vision.
