# Legal & Regulatory Framework

This document summarizes the intended legal positioning of Athena Protocol.

---

## 1. Non-Financial Nature

Athena is designed as a **rights-based governance and coordination framework**, not as a financial protocol.

It does **not**:

- issue or sell financial instruments  
- hold or manage user funds  
- provide payment, exchange, or custody services  
- offer profit participation, yield, or dividends  

---

## 2. Token Classification

- **ATHENA** – non-transferable rights and participation token  
- **CREDIT** – non-transferable internal redemption unit  
- **WORK** – internal activity/coordination unit  
- **GOVT** – governance participation token  

None of these tokens:

- are meant to be traded on markets;  
- represent equity, debt, or ownership;  
- promise financial return or appreciation;  
- are sold to raise capital.  

---

## 3. Regulatory Context

Athena is designed to fall **outside** typical financial regulatory categories, including:

- **Securities law** (e.g., SEC in the U.S.)  
- **MiCA “asset-referenced tokens” (ART)**  
- **MiCA “e-money tokens” (EMT)**  
- **Investment services**  
- **Payment services**  
- **Custody & deposit-taking**  

Instead, it should be understood as:

> A digital governance and rights coordination system for communities.

## 4. Disclaimer

Nothing in the Athena Protocol codebase or documentation constitutes legal, financial, or investment advice.

Anyone deploying or integrating Athena:

- is responsible for their own compliance;  
- must ensure their use case aligns with local laws;  
- should consult legal counsel when in doubt.
