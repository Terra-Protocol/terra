# Founders & IMAP Directory

This folder contains public “Founding Member Letters” for Athena Protocol, as defined by the Initial Member Admission Protocol (IMAP).

Each file in this directory should:

- be a public statement written by the candidate;  
- include their name (or pseudonym, if appropriate), background, and motivation;  
- describe alignment with Athena’s values and non-financial principles;  
- be versioned and signed where possible (e.g., PGP, on-chain reference).

Example filenames:

- `001_alex-example.md`  
- `002_robin-example.md`  
- `003_…`

The presence of a letter here does **not** imply any legal or financial relationship.  
It is a transparency and governance tool only.
