Founder — About Me

My name is Robin Schaarschmidt, and I am the founder and conceptual architect behind the Terra Protocol.

I am not a programmer and I do not come from a technical background.
My strengths are in:
	•	governance design
	•	decentralized decision-making models
	•	social and economic system architecture
	•	long-term vision and coordination
	•	structural thinking, values, and conceptual development

I created the entire conceptual foundation of Terra — including:
	•	Governance 2.0
	•	IMAP (Initial Member Admission Protocol)
	•	CDC (Consensus Delegation Council)
	•	token logic (TERRA, GOVT, CREDIT)
	•	revenue routing structure
	•	the whitepaper
	•	the roadmap
	•	architecture direction and long-term vision

My role in Terra is system design, coordination, vision, values, and community-building, not software development.
This is intentional: Terra is a governance-first protocol, and its logic must be carefully designed before engineering begins.

Founding Contributors

At this early stage, I am supported by a few non-technical contributors who help with:
	•	values & ethics
	•	community perspective
	•	structural thinking
	•	review and feedback on governance concepts
	•	alignment of long-term vision

None of them are programmers.
The technical team will be built in Phase 1.

Technical Team — Phase 1 Hiring Plan

Once Phase 1 begins, I will assemble a dedicated developer team from within the Polkadot ecosystem.
This approach is intentional because:
	•	Polkadot/Substrate engineers understand runtime and pallet development
	•	They are familiar with governance and XCM
	•	They have experience building public-good infrastructure
	•	They can implement complex governance & economic mechanisms safely

The planned hiring process is:
	1.	Publish developer openings in the Polkadot community
(Polkadot Forum, Polkadot Discord, Element channels, Rust/Substrate developer spaces, Parity contacts)
	2.	Evaluate interested developers
	3.	Assemble a team of 2–4 engineers for Phase 1
	4.	Begin implementing the core modules
(TERRA, GOVT, CREDIT, Revenue Router, Governance Engine)

Developers will be onboarded with:
	•	the full conceptual documentation
	•	the architecture specifications
	•	governance rules
	•	clear milestones & deliverables

This ensures that Terra is implemented precisely according to its original governance and system design.
