# Terra Governance 2.0

Terra Governance 2.0 defines how decisions are made across the Terra Protocol.  
It is based on a balanced model combining **Founder stability**, **community participation**,  
and **long-term decentralization**.

---

## 🎯 Core Governance Principles

- **Terra** = Sovereign Rights Token  
  Fixed supply, non-inflationary, used for strategic and constitutional decisions.

- **GOVT** = Governance Participation Token  
  Earned through contribution; inflationary; used for day-to-day community governance.

- **CREDIT** = Revenue Rights Token  
  Elastic, non-transferable; scales with ecosystem growth; not used for voting.

---

## 🏛 Governance Layers

### 1. Daily Governance (GOVT-only)
Used for operational decisions:
- Budgets
- Project approvals
- Parameter changes
- Working group decisions
- Team roles and process updates

Workers influence the system through contribution and earned GOVT.

---

### 2. Strategic Governance (Terra + GOVT weighted)
Used for high-impact decisions:
- Economic parameters
- Reward-rate adjustments
- Distribution rules for CREDIT
- Worker onboarding rules
- Rights-management logic

Votes combine:
- Terra share (fixed rights)
- GOVT share (earned rights)

---

### 3. Sovereign Governance (Terra-only)
Used for constitutional decisions:
- Treasury structure & spending policies
- Foundational protocol rules
- Long-term identity and value protection
- Emergency or recovery actions
- Governance framework changes

Founder holds a permanent **20% Terra allocation**  
(no dilution, no inflation).  

Community Terra holders can collectively exceed this,  
but no single participant may surpass the **individual Terra Cap** (e.g., 15%).

---

## 🔐 Inheritance & Delegation

### Delegation
Any Terra holder can delegate voting rights to another address.  
Ownership does not change — only voting power.

### Smart Inheritance
To prevent lost Terra due to death or lost wallets:
- Terra can define a recovery address.
- Inactivity triggers a recovery period.
- After timeout, Terra transfers to the predefined successor.
- Alternatively manually confirmed by a Governance Council.

---

## 👥 Terra Distribution Model

- **20% Terra — Founder (permanent)**
- **20% Terra — Worker Pool** (earned through GOVT reputation)
- **55% Terra — Treasury** (ecosystem, public goods, long-term reserves)
- **5% Terra — Partnerships**

Worker Terra Pool is fixed → **no inflation, no dilution.**

---

## 🧠 Governance Philosophy

Terra balances:
- stable long-term vision (Founder Terra)
- democratic operation (GOVT)
- scalable economics (CREDIT)
- protection from political or ideological capture
- sustainability and human-centric values

---

## 📬 Participation

Anyone can join governance by:
- contributing work  
- earning GOVT  
- participating in votes  
- or delegating / receiving delegated Terra  

This system is designed to grow into a self-sustaining digital nation with  
transparent rules and protected core values.
At that point:

- Delegation ends  
- CDC no longer influences Terra votes  
- Governance transitions to a fully capable community  
- Founder retains personal 20% sovereign allocation  

---

### 🔹 Fail-Safe

If the CDC becomes inactive or blocked:

- Delegation automatically turns off  
- Founder Terra regains full voting power for sovereign decisions  
- Daily governance remains unaffected (GOVT continues to operate normally)  

---

### 🔹 Summary

The CDC enables:

- early community influence  
- extremely safe decision-making  
- stable transition to decentralization  
- protection from ideological capture  
- reduced Founder dominance without losing security  

It is a **unique governance innovation** designed to make Terra secure,
fair, and resilient from its earliest stages.
