# Terra Governance 2.0

Terra Governance 2.0 defines how decisions are made across the Terra Protocol.  
It is based on a balanced model combining **Founder stability**, **community participation**,  
and **long-term decentralization**.

---

## 🎯 Core Governance Principles

- **Terra** = Sovereign Rights Token  
  Fixed supply, non-inflationary, used for strategic and constitutional decisions.

- **GOVT** = Governance Participation Token  
  Earned through contribution; inflationary; used for day-to-day community governance.

- **CREDIT** = Revenue Rights Token  
  Elastic, non-transferable; scales with ecosystem growth; not used for voting.

---

## 🏛 Governance Layers

### 1. Daily Governance (GOVT-only)
Used for operational decisions:
- Budgets
- Project approvals
- Parameter changes
- Working group decisions
- Team roles and process updates

Workers influence the system through contribution and earned GOVT.

---

### 2. Strategic Governance (Terra + GOVT weighted)
Used for high-impact decisions:
- Economic parameters
- Reward-rate adjustments
- Distribution rules for CREDIT
- Worker onboarding rules
- Rights-management logic

Votes combine:
- Terra share (fixed rights)
- GOVT share (earned rights)

---

### 3. Sovereign Governance (Terra-only)
Used for constitutional decisions:
- Treasury structure & spending policies
- Foundational protocol rules
- Long-term identity and value protection
- Emergency or recovery actions
- Governance framework changes

Founder holds a permanent **20% Terra allocation**  
(no dilution, no inflation).  

Community Terra holders can collectively exceed this,  
but no single participant may surpass the **individual Terra Cap** (e.g., 15%).

---

## 🔐 Inheritance & Delegation

### Delegation
Any Terra holder can delegate voting rights to another address.  
Ownership does not change — only voting power.

### Smart Inheritance
To prevent lost Terra due to death or lost wallets:
- Terra can define a recovery address.
- Inactivity triggers a recovery period.
- After timeout, Terra transfers to the predefined successor.
- Alternatively manually confirmed by a Governance Council.

---

## 👥 Terra Distribution Model

- **20% Terra — Founder (permanent)**
- **20% Terra — Worker Pool** (earned through GOVT reputation)
- **55% Terra — Treasury** (ecosystem, public goods, long-term reserves)
- **5% Terra — Partnerships**

Worker Terra Pool is fixed → **no inflation, no dilution.**

---

## 🧠 Governance Philosophy

Terra balances:
- stable long-term vision (Founder Terra)
- democratic operation (GOVT)
- scalable economics (CREDIT)
- protection from political or ideological capture
- sustainability and human-centric values

---

## 📬 Participation

Anyone can join governance by:
- contributing work  
- earning GOVT  
- participating in votes  
- or delegating / receiving delegated Terra  

This system is designed to grow into a self-sustaining digital nation with  
transparent rules and protected core values.
At that point:

- Delegation ends  
- CDC no longer influences Terra votes  
- Governance transitions to a fully capable community  
- Founder retains personal 20% sovereign allocation

## 🧩 Consensus Delegation Council (CDC)

The Consensus Delegation Council introduces a transitional mechanism that allows
the community to participate in **strategic and sovereign governance** before
they have earned significant amounts of Terra.

The CDC receives **temporary delegated voting power** from the Founder, which
becomes active only under **unanimous consensus**.

---

### 🔹 Purpose

- Share strategic decision-making from the early phase  
- Provide community legitimacy before Terra is widely distributed  
- Maintain stability and protect core values  
- Prevent any single individual from gaining excessive influence  
- Enable smooth transition to long-term decentralization  

---

### 🔹 Delegation Model

The Founder may delegate a specific portion of Terra voting power
(e.g., 5–10%) to the CDC.

Characteristics:

- Delegation grants **voting rights only**  
- Ownership of Terra **does not** change  
- Delegated Terra **cannot** be transferred, inherited, or sold  
- Delegation is **automatically reversible**  

---

### 🔹 Unanimous Consensus Requirement

The CDC's delegated Terra counts **only if all Members vote YES**.

If even one Member votes NO or abstains:

- Delegated Terra becomes inactive  
- Full voting power reverts to the Founder for that decision  
- CDC influence is excluded from quorum calculations  

This ensures maximum safety and prevents Council capture.

---

### 🔹 Automatic Deactivation

The CDC is temporary.

Delegation auto-disables when the community collectively earns a predefined
amount of Terra, e.g.:Community Terra ≥ 20%
At that point:

- Delegation ends  
- CDC no longer influences Terra votes  
- Governance transitions to a fully capable community  
- Founder retains personal 20% sovereign allocation  

---

### 🔹 Fail-Safe

If the CDC becomes inactive or blocked:

- Delegation automatically turns off  
- Founder Terra regains full voting power for sovereign decisions  
- Daily governance remains unaffected (GOVT continues to operate normally)  

---

### 🔹 Summary

The CDC enables:

- early community influence  
- extremely safe decision-making  
- stable transition to decentralization  
- protection from ideological capture  
- reduced Founder dominance without losing security  

It is a **unique governance innovation** designed to make Terra secure,
fair, and resilient from its earliest stages.


Initial Member Admission Protocol (IMAP)

IMAP defines how the first generation of governance participants enters Terra.
It ensures that early governance is safe, aligned, and built on shared values.

Purpose
	•	Protect early governance from ideological or political capture
	•	Admit only value-aligned individuals
	•	Build trust inside the initial core team
	•	Prepare the system for long-term decentralization
	•	Guarantee a stable base for the Consensus Delegation Council (CDC)

Founding Member Letters

Each candidate must publish a “Founding Member Letter” containing:
	•	their background
	•	their values
	•	their vision for Terra
	•	motivation for joining
	•	commitment to community ethics

All letters are stored in the public repo under /founders.

Unanimous Acceptance

New members are accepted only if 100% of existing Founding Members agree.
A single objection blocks admission.

This prevents early ideological conflicts and builds a unified governance core.

Rights Granted

Upon acceptance, a Founding Member gains:
	•	participation in governance
	•	eligibility to earn GOVT
	•	eligibility to earn Terra from the Worker Pool
	•	CDC voting privileges (until CDC deactivation phase)

Relationship with CDC

Founding Members form the initial CDC group.
CDC receives delegated Terra voting power from the Founder that activates only with unanimous consensus.
Delegation ends automatically when the community earns sufficient Terra.

Transition to Open Admission

IMAP is temporary.
Later, Terra introduces scalable onboarding mechanisms (e.g., reputation-, contribution-, or values-based entry).

IMAP ensures the early governance foundation is secure, ethical, and aligned before the system becomes fully open.
